# Documentation

This repository contains the codes for implementing the Conformal Prediction algorithm for Hidden Markov Models proposed in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02271 (ICML 2023)

# Details
1. The numerical results were generated using the "Code_numerical_results.py" file
2. The empirical results were generated using the "Code_empirical_results.ipynb" file. The datasets used for experiments are contained in the same directory. 
Both files rely on the "Methods.py" file which contains the implementation of the main algorithm. 


Outputs: The figure with the results will be stored in PDF format in the same folder
